This challenge evaluates knowledge in transforming and modifying functions and code according to given instructions. Read the entire document before starting to ensure the best approach.

## Description

Applying the concepts and tools learned, develop the following exercises to practice the key elements of the unit.

## Requirements

1. Transform a function declaration into a function expression. The exercise should be in a file named 1_funcion.js.

2. Transform a function into a one-line arrow function. This exercise should be in a file named 2_arrow.js.

3. Modify a code that changes the background color of an HTML element when clicked. The code should be in two files: pintar.html and script.js. The script should be inside the assets/js folder. Modify the function to receive the clicked element and allow passing a color as an argument.

4. Build a webpage 4_colores.html with four divs of different colors. When clicking on each div, it should change its color to black.

5. Create a webpage along with a script that stores a color in a global variable depending on the pressed keyboard key. Create a div that changes color when certain keys are pressed and another div that is created with different colors when other keys are pressed.

Tip: Use addEventListener to add events and check the study guide for additional examples.
