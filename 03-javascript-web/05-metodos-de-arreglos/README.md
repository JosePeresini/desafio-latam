# Challenge 5 - Todo List

In this challenge, we will validate our knowledge to dynamically add elements to a web page. To achieve this, you will need to apply what you have learned in the guide.

## Description

Applying the concepts and tools learned so far, you must create a web page that allows you to keep track of pending tasks. In summary, it should update every time a task is added, modified, or deleted. The user should be able to add new tasks through an input, which will be listed with their details and options to mark them as done or delete them.

Tasks should be recorded in an array of objects that stores the id, description, and whether it is completed or not. When a task is completed, the text style can be changed or it can appear as a text that says "completed".

## Requirements

1. Add tasks with a description by filling in the input and pressing the add task button. The task is added to the array and then the list on the web page is updated.
2. Delete a task by clicking the button that accompanies the task. The data should be deleted from the array and the list updated.
3. Count the total number of tasks, keeping this count updated when a new task is added or a task is deleted.
4. Mark a task as completed by clicking a "change" button (or a checkbox can be used).
5. Count the total number of completed tasks.
6. The code includes at least 3 initial tasks in the array, and these are displayed on the web page by iterating over the array.
