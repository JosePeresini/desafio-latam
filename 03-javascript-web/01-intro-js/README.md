# Challenge 1 - Calculating the Total

In this challenge, the objective is to implement the card of a product displayed in an online store and add user interaction, allowing the modification of the quantity and value of the product.

**Time Associated**: 90 minutes

## Description

For this challenge, you will use the tools we learned to manipulate DOM elements using the `querySelector` method. A base HTML file named **“Material de Apoyo - Base desafío calculando el total”** will be available on the platform. When you open this material, you will see the following result in the browser.

This base project contains the HTML structure, styles, and a base JS file. The latter shows the quantity and base price using `querySelector()`.

Using this base as an explanation, you need to make the + and - buttons functional. These should modify the quantity of products to buy. Additionally, the total to pay should reflect the results based on the quantity of selected items.

For example, if the quantity is 100, then the result will be the base price multiplied by the quantity.

### Hints:

- To make the buttons work, use the `onClick()` event.
- If you need to review topics related to the `onClick()` event, refer to the study guide in the section **“Manipulating the DOM in response to an event.”**

## Requirements

1. Add the JavaScript event that reacts to a click on the corresponding HTML element. (2.5 points)
2. Apply `querySelector()` and `innerHTML()` correctly to modify the DOM elements. (2.5 points)
3. Implement the logic to modify the total to pay based on the quantity. (2.5 points)
4. Make the + and - buttons functional to increase and decrease the quantity of products. (2.5 points)
