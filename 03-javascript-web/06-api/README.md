# Test - Currency Converter

In this test, we will validate our knowledge of the fetch method. Read the entire document before starting individual development.

## Description

Applying the concepts and tools learned so far, you must program a currency converter from an amount in Chilean pesos. For this, it will be necessary to consult the mindicador.cl API using the fetch method. If the API is not available, you can use the offline version found in the file "Support test - Currency Converter".

## Features

- An input to enter the amount of Chilean pesos to convert.
- A select to choose the currency to convert.
- A button to start the query and data rendering process.

Then, use a JavaScript chart library to show a history of the last 10 days of the selected currency value.

## Requirements

1. Obtain exchange rates from mindicador.cl.
2. Correctly calculate the exchange and display it in the DOM.
3. Implement more than one type of currency in the select.
4. Use try catch to execute the fetch method and capture possible errors, displaying the error in the DOM.
5. Implement the requested chart.
