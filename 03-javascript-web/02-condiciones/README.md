# 2nd Challenge - Frontend

This project was created as part of the 2nd Challenge in the Frontend course at Desaf√≠o Latam, with the goal of practicing and reinforcing skills in creating interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

The challenge consists of three interactive sections that implement different concepts of user interaction using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### 1. **Interactive Borders**

In this section, when you click on a world image, a red border is applied or removed depending on its current state. This is achieved using JavaScript to dynamically change the image styles.

- **HTML**: A `<figure>` element containing an `<img>` and a `<figcaption>`.
- **CSS**: Styles are applied to the image and the border properties are set.
- **JavaScript**: An `onclick` event on the image changes its border.

### 2. **Stickers**

Here, the user can input the number of stickers they want to buy from three characters. The total number of stickers is calculated and displayed dynamically. If the total exceeds 10, a message is shown indicating that too many stickers are being bought.

- **HTML**: `<input>` elements are used to allow the user to enter values.
- **CSS**: Styles are applied for the presentation of the stickers and the input fields.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality to calculate the total and show an error message if the number exceeds the limit.

### 3. **Password Selectors**

In this section, the user must select the correct options from a set of three dropdown menus. If the selected options match the "correct" password, a message appears indicating that the password is correct, and the container's border color changes.

- **HTML**: Three dropdown menus (`<select>`) with multiple options (`<option>`).
- **CSS**: Styles for the dropdown menus, submit button, and message display.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality to verify the selected options and show a message based on whether the password is correct or incorrect.

## Project Structure

- `border.html`: Page that implements the interactive border functionality.
- `stickers.html`: Page where the user interacts with stickers and makes calculations.
- `select.html`: Page with dropdown menus to validate the "password".
- `assets/css/style.css`: Common styles for all pages.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Basic structure of the pages.
- **CSS**: Visual design and styling.
- **JavaScript**: Interactive logic to change elements on the page.
